# TensorFlow 框架工具箱 Ludwig
>Ludwig has been developed and tested with Python 3 in mind. If you don’t have Python 3 installed, install it by running:
```
sudo apt install python3  # on ubuntu
brew install python3      # on mac
```

At the time of writing this document, TensorFlow is not compatible with Python 3.7, so the recommended version of Python for Ludwig is 3.6. 

 You may want to use a virtual environment to maintain an isolated [Python environment](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/).

- In order to install Ludwig just run:
```
pip install ludwig
python -m spacy download en
```

- or install it by building the source code from the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:uber/ludwig.git
cd ludwig
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en
python setup.py install
```
